# Jason Turkey

## Why does this exist?
Hi, my name is Jason Turley. For generations, my last name has been auto-corrected to
"Turkey". Being the humorous fellow that I am, I purchased the domain name
[jasonturkey.xyz](https://jasonturkey.xyz) for when visitors mistype
[jasonturley.xyz](https://jasonturley.xyz).
